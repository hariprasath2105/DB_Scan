# 🏦 DBSCAN-Based Anomaly Detection in Banking

This project implements a simple **Anomaly Detection system** for banking transactions using **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** algorithm. The system is deployed using **Flask** with a visually enhanced HTML/CSS frontend.

---

## 📌 Objective

Detect unusual transactions (possible fraud) based on:
- **Transaction Amount**
- **Transaction Time**

## 📊 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: DBSCAN (unsupervised)
- **Features used**: Transaction Amount, Transaction Time
- **Output**: `Normal Transaction ✅` or `Anomaly Detected ❌`

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Input is scaled using `StandardScaler`
2. The trained DBSCAN model checks if input fits into any known dense cluster
3. If not part of any cluster → flagged as **anomaly (`-1`)**

---

## ✅ Sample Normal Inputs

| Amount | Time |
|--------|------|
| 105    | 11.5 |
| 110    | 12   |
| 100    | 10   |

These inputs are within the dense cluster area.

---

## ❌ Sample Anomaly Inputs

| Amount | Time |
|--------|------|
| 500    | 5    |
| 1000   | 1    |
| 1200   | 2    |

These are far from any known dense cluster in training data.

## 🚀 Run the App

```bash
# Step 1: Train the model
python model.py

# Step 2: Run the Flask app
python app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
